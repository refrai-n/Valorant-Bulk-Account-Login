# Valorant-Bulk-Account-Login
𝙃𝙤𝙬 𝙩𝙤 𝙪𝙨𝙚: 
1. Make a text file and copy all your accounts to it as a list (You only have to do this once don't worry). Example is attached as a pic.
2. Download and build the program , run "Val Booster.exe". 
3. Click on select file and select the account list file you created. 
4. Now just open up the login page (I recommend using Riot Client as it automatically opens login page after you logout an account. 
5. Click Next. The bot will login the first account for you, After you are done with your account just logout normally and click next to login the next account. 

Skip feature: If you want to skip the current account and go to the next one just click the skip button( Example: If you want to skip to account #15 in your list then keep clicking skip until you see account #14 on the screen and then press Next to login account #15.

If your desktop resolution isn't 1920x1080p then do this first:
There's a file in the final folder called "username.png" open it and look at it, now open rito client and use snipping tool and take a screenshot of the username box area, it should be the same as the username file, now replace the username.png with the new ss you took with snipping tool. Do the same with password.png.
